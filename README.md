# Quantum Drake Equation Simulator Using Qiskit

This project uses Qiskit, IBM's open-source framework for quantum computing, to simulate the probabilistic factors of the Drake Equation. The Drake Equation is a famous formula used to estimate the number of active, communicative extraterrestrial civilizations in the Milky Way galaxy.

## Overview

The script will output a histogram representing the probability distribution of each simulated factor of the Drake Equation. An even distribution of measurement results indicates equal probabilities for each factor in our simplified model.

The purpose of this simulation is to provide an educational tool to demonstrate the application of quantum superposition and measurement in modeling probabilistic systems, using the Drake Equation as a thematic example.

## Features

- Quantum circuit creation with Qiskit
- Simulation of superposition states for binary variables
- Measurement and probability analysis of quantum states
- Visualization of the simulation results with a histogram

## Installation

Ensure you have Python 3.6 or later installed on your system. To install Qiskit and other required packages, run:

```bash
pip install qiskit matplotlib

# Quantum Drake Equation Simulator

This project uses Qiskit, IBM's open-source framework for quantum computing, to simulate the probabilistic factors of the Drake Equation. The Drake Equation is a famous formula used to estimate the number of active, communicative extraterrestrial civilizations in the Milky Way galaxy.

## Overview

The purpose of this simulation is to provide an educational tool to demonstrate the application of quantum superposition and measurement in modeling probabilistic systems, using the Drake Equation as a thematic example.

## Features

- Quantum circuit creation with Qiskit
- Simulation of superposition states for binary variables
- Measurement and probability analysis of quantum states
- Visualization of the simulation results with a histogram

## Installation

Ensure you have Python 3.6 or later installed on your system. To install Qiskit and other required packages, run:

```bash
pip install qiskit matplotlib
